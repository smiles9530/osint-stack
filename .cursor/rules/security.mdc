Core Levels of App Security
1) Stability of Security (No Fatal Flaws)

Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)Understand this error
api/v1/auth/login/:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)Understand this error
auth-context-B7olMIEw.js:1  POST http://localhost/api/v1/auth/login/ 500 (Internal Server Error)Do

No hardcoded secrets or credentials in code.

Always use HTTPS/TLS everywhere (API, DB, external calls).

Sanitize/validate all user input (SQL injection, XSS, command injection).

Secure authentication (no plaintext passwords, no weak hashing ‚Äî use bcrypt/argon2).

Measure

Static code analysis (lint, SonarQube, SAST tools).

Vulnerability scans (e.g., OWASP ZAP).

Zero ‚Äúcritical‚Äù findings in penetration testing.

2) Access & Authentication (Keep It Tight)

Do

Enforce least privilege for users, APIs, and services.

MFA for admins and sensitive operations.

Strong session management (rotate tokens, short-lived JWTs, secure cookies).

Role-based (RBAC) or attribute-based (ABAC) access controls.

Measure

Percentage of accounts with MFA enabled.

Audit of role creep (users with excessive permissions).

Failed login attempt metrics & lockout policies.

3) Data Protection (Protect Assets)

Do

Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256, FIPS modules).

Hash + salt passwords (never reversible).

Tokenize or pseudonymize sensitive data where possible.

Mask data in logs and dashboards.

Measure

Encryption coverage (100% of sensitive tables/fields).

No sensitive data leaks in logs/monitoring.

Periodic key rotation success.

4) Resilience & Monitoring (Detect & Respond)

Do

Centralized logging + SIEM (detect anomalies, brute-force attempts, SQLi patterns).

Intrusion detection/prevention (IDS/IPS, WAF).

Rate limiting & throttling to prevent abuse.

Security alerts integrated with incident response playbooks.

Measure

Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) & Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).

Alert fidelity (low false positives).

Number of blocked malicious requests per week.

5) Scalability of Security (Built-In, Not Bolted-On)

Do

Secure coding practices baked into CI/CD (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).

Automated patch management (containers, OS, libraries).

Threat modeling & regular penetration testing.

Zero-trust architecture: never trust internal traffic by default.

Measure

Number of vulnerabilities caught in CI before production.

Dependency freshness (no critical CVEs older than X days).

Compliance posture (ISO 27001, SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA depending on domain).

Quick Wins (80/20 for Security)

Add Content Security Policy (CSP) to stop XSS.

Turn on security headers: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options.

Use a password manager + secrets vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

Keep dependencies updated (npm audit, pip-audit, Snyk, Dependabot).

Enable 2FA everywhere (dev, admin, prod).

Daily backup with tested restore process.

Minimal ‚ÄúSecurity CI/CD‚Äù Loop

Define Baseline: no critical CVEs; 100% TLS; 100% MFA for admin.

Automate Scans: SAST + DAST in pipeline; dependency scanning.

Test: staging pen-tests before prod release.

Monitor: SIEM + WAF alerts tied to on-call.

Review & Harden: regular threat modeling + patch reviews.

Architecture Cheatsheet

Network: firewalls, VPC isolation, private subnets, VPN for admin.

API: rate limits, JWT rotation, schema validation, WAF.

Infra: hardened containers (read-only FS, minimal images), secrets outside code.

Users: least privilege, short-lived credentials, logging of all privileged ops.

üëâ In short, secure apps evolve like this:
No fatal flaws ‚Üí Strong auth ‚Üí Data protection ‚Üí Detection/response ‚Üí Built-in zero trust.
